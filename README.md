# Video-transcription
Video Transcription Generator
This Python script automatically generates a text transcription from a video file. It extracts the audio from the video, processes it in chunks, and uses Google's Speech Recognition service to create a timestamped transcription.
Features

Extracts audio from video files
Generates timestamped transcriptions
Saves transcriptions to a text file

Requirements

Python 3.6 or higher
moviepy
SpeechRecognition

Installation

Clone this repository or download the script files.
Install the required Python packages:
Copypip install -r requirements.txt
Note: On some systems, you might need to install additional audio processing libraries. For example:

On Ubuntu or Debian-based systems:
Copysudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio

On macOS using Homebrew:
Copybrew install portaudio
pip install pyaudio




Usage

Place your video file in the same directory as the script, or note its full path.
Open the script (video_transcription.py) and modify the video_path variable with your video file's name or path:
pythonCopyvideo_path = "your_video.mp4"  # Replace with your video file path

Run the script:
Copypython video_transcription.py

The script will process the video and generate a transcription.txt file in the same directory.

Output
The transcription.txt file will contain timestamped transcriptions in the following format:
Copystart_time - end_time: transcribed text
For example:
Copy0.00 - 3.00: Hello, welcome to the video
3.00 - 6.00: Today we'll be discussing...
Limitations

The accuracy of the transcription depends on the audio quality and the performance of the Google Speech Recognition service.
Very long videos may take a considerable amount of time to process.
The script requires an active internet connection to use the Google Speech Recognition service.
